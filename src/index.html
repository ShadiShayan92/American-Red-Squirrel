    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
      The American red squirrel is one of three species of tree squirrel known as the pine squirrel. This species usually lives in coniferous and deciduous forests. In such places, it is easy to find conical cones full of rodent seeds. Therefore, the red squirrels that live there tend to keep a large number of these cones in storage sites called "middens". A field can be in the form of an underground hideout - or a pile of cones next to a tree trunk.
      The squirrel is a small mammal weighing 200 to 250 grams per day that defends its monopoly territory throughout the year. <br>
  Red squirrels can be easily distinguished from other North American tree squirrels by their smaller size, total length 28 to 35 cm (including tail), regional behavior, 
  and reddish fur with white umbilicus. Red squirrels are somewhat larger than squirrels.<br>
  American red squirrels are widely distributed throughout the North American continent. They cover most of Canada, with the exception of the treeless northern hemisphere, 
  the southern half of Alberta and the southwest coast of British Columbia. South Alaska; Rocky Mountains of the United States, and the northeastern half of the United
  States. American red squirrels are found in abundance and do not worry about protection in many areas. American red squirrels were introduced to Newfoundland and have 
  been living there in abundance for decades. In 1987, this part of the population was included in the list of endangered species.<br>
  American red squirrels are mostly grains, but occasionally include other foods in their diet. The sap, bark, fruits and flowers of the red squirrel are also involved. But seeds are their main source of food.
<br>
  American red squirrels eat a variety of mushrooms, including some that are deadly to humans.Mushrooms are a favorite food. Sometimes, these will require a little preparation. Red squirrels pick mushrooms from the ground and then hang them on tree branches to dry.<br>
  American red squirrels ovulate spontaneously. Females enter estrus for only one day, but leave their territory before ovulation, 
  and these exploratory attacks may be helpful in promoting their future estrus. On the day of estrus, females are chased by several males in pursuit of 
  long-term mating. Males compete for the opportunity to mate with estrus. Females mate with 4 to 16 males. Pregnancy is reported to be between 31 and 35 days. 
  Females can reproduce for the first time at the age of one, but some females delay reproduction by two years or more. Most females produce one litter per year, 
  but in some years reproduction is abandoned, while in other years some females reproduce twice. The size of the bed usually varies from one to five, but most beds 
  have three or four children. Babies are pink and hairless at birth and weigh about 10 grams.<br>
  Nests are usually made of grass in the branches of trees. American red squirrels rarely nest underground.<br>
  Red squirrels are very territorial and anti-social and have very few infertile physical interactions. Most physical interactions are between male and female 
  mating and between females and their offspring before the offspring disperse in their territory. Recorded non-reproductive physical interactions were all examples of 
  an invader being chased from a territory.<br>
  To survive, American juvenile red squirrels must gain territory before their first winter. They can gain territory by competing for an empty territory, 
  creating a new territory, or receiving all or part of a territory from their mothers. This somewhat rare female behavior is referred to as reproductive scattering 
  or willpower and is a kind of maternal investment for children. The prevalence of this behavior is related to the abundance of food sources and the age of the mother. 
  In some cases, females acquire additional farms before reproduction, which they then pass on to their offspring. Children who do not receive midwifery from their mother usually live within 150 meters (3 diameters of the territory) of their place of birth. Observations show that male red squirrels induce alternative fertility strategies in the environment, leading to sexually selective infanticide during years when food is plentiful.<br>
  American red squirrels experience early severe mortality. However, the proba
bility of survival increases until the age of three, when it begins to decline again. 
  Women who live up to one year have a life expectancy of 3.5 years and a maximum life expectancy of 8 years. Increased maternal attention is associated with increased 
  child growth rate and higher fertility success throughout life.<br>
